      <p>
        This page demonstrates how a very simple sorting algorithm works.
        This algorithm is typically called "I can't believe it can sort"
        but since that name is long and silly I will refer to it as
        *quadsort*. I am calling it quadsort because its time complexity
        is quadratic independently of the original data. This means that
        this algorithm is asympototically less efficient than the most
        widely used sorting algorithms and is probably not a good algorithm
        to choose in most cases. It is nonetheless interesting because it
        is very simple and can be written in only about 4 lines of code.

      <p>
        Here is a listing of the quadsort code used for this page:

        This page displays the progress of the algorithm as an n x n matrix
        where n is the number of items in the list being sorted. Each row
        of the matrix corresponds to the permutation of the original data
        that is generated by one step through the outer loop of the
        algorithm. This allows us to get a clearer picture of how the
        algorithm works. Note that each element on the diagonal of the
        matrix is always less than every element that follows it. Moreover
        the diagnonal element and all elements that precede it are
        correctly sorted in ascending order. As long as this invariant is
        maintained we see that the final row will be completely sorted.

        It appears that this algorithm was first published by Stanley Fung
        in 2021 in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01111">paper</a>.
